### Apply PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to solve the CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark for image classification. 
### The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images of size 32x32, divided into 10 classes, such as airplane, bird, cat, dog, etc. 
### The goal is to train a neural network that can accurately classify these images.
